# Portfolio

This is my first portfolio website. I intentionally spiced it up and moved away from the traditional discussion laptop photos and etc and used anime photos and etc. 

I tried to make the webpage responsive and made a banner and have a navigation bar on the top that will also help visotors navigate the website. 

Thanks
